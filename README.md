# ELK Stack

The ELK stack is a powerful data analytics and search stack composed of three open-source components: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. This stack enables efficient storage, processing, and visualization of large volumes of data.

## Components

### 1. Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a distributed, real-time search and analytics engine. It provides a highly scalable solution for storing, searching, and analyzing data in near real-time. Elasticsearch uses a flexible JSON document model and offers advanced search capabilities.

### 2. Logstash

Logstash is a versatile data processing pipeline. It collects data from various sources, such as log files, databases, and message queues. Logstash applies filters to parse and transform the data before sending it to the desired destination. It can be used to enrich, aggregate, and modify data as per your requirements.

### 3. Kibana

Kibana is a powerful data visualization and exploration tool. It offers a user-friendly web interface to interact with Elasticsearch. With Kibana, you can create visualizations, dashboards, and reports based on your data. It supports a wide range of visualizations to help you gain valuable insights and perform in-depth analysis.

## Use Cases

The ELK stack is widely used in various use cases, including:

- Log analysis: Centralize and analyze logs from different sources for troubleshooting, monitoring, and performance optimization.
- Real-time monitoring: Monitor system metrics, network traffic, or application performance in real-time to identify issues promptly.
- Security analytics: Analyze security logs and events to detect anomalies, investigate threats, and enhance cybersecurity.
- Business intelligence: Perform data analysis and create visualizations to gain insights into business metrics, customer behavior, and market trends.

## Getting Started

To get started with the ELK stack, follow the installation and configuration guides provided by each component:
